const { recalculateCommission } = require('./src/lib/logic/commissions'); // Note: This won't work directly with ts-node usually due to aliases
// Actually, I can't easily run a script that imports 'src/...' aliases without tsconfig paths setup.
// I will create a small standalone script or use an existing one?

// Better approach: Create a temporary route or just use the tool capability to run a comprehensive script if I can.
// But I don't have a 'run_script' tool that handles Next.js context easily.
// I'll creates a temporary file in `scripts/` if possible, or just use a new migration if I needed to clear data, but I need to trigger the logic.

// Actually, I can use a simpler approach: 
// 1. Manually zero out the ledger entries for that payment? No, that doesn't trigger recalc.
// 2. I need to invoke `calculateCommission`.
// The user has a "Recalculate" button maybe? 
// No, I should fix it for them.

// I will create a temporary API route that I can call via curl.
console.log("Plan: Create temp API route to trigger recalculation");
